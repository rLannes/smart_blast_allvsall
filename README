This script is usefull to make blast all against all, which are at posterior filter by coverge as it reduce
 considerably the number of alignment to do. Simply by doing only the necessary alignment. We tested it on 40 000
 sequences it show a speed up almost 4x. We strongly believe that this speed up may increase with the size of the
 dataset.

for simple command line information you can use python3 blast_AvA_optimised.py -h
